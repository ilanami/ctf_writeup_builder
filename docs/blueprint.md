# **App Name**: WriteUp Terminal

## Core Features:

- Write-up editor: A terminal-inspired interface that enables the user to write and structure CTF write-ups. The app will allow import and export of JSON files and data will persist locally.
- Customizable Sections: User can customize write-up sections. Add/remove/reorder sections to adapt the editor to specific challenges.
- Live Preview: Preview the generated write-up as it is built.
- Export: Allows exporting to a PDF for wider distribution, or as markdown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background (#0A0A0A) to simulate a terminal interface.
- Primary color: Neon green (#00FF00) for text to maintain the hacker aesthetic. Should only be used for key pieces of information or for short highlights.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements, buttons, and important UI affordances.
- Use monospace fonts to mimic terminal output.
- Simple line icons for actions and section types, complementing the terminal aesthetic.
- A layout with a sidebar for general information and settings, a central panel for the write-up sections, and a preview panel.
